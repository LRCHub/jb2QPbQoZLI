Excuse me can't you see
That I am here dancing?
Then you get in my way
Oh that was your mistake
This is the dancefloor
It isn't made to walk
Now get out of my way
You're invading my space

Hey you, walkin' through
What you think you're try'na do?
Just 'cause you're off your face
Does not mean you get in my way
There's other ways to the door
I just wanna dance som'more
If you haven't danced yet
What the fuck d'you come for?
