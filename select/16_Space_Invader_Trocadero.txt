It's Time for you to know
Call this an Early warning
My late resignation

It seems all systems are go
For this emergency transmission
Three, two, one, zero

You are like a space invader
You crippled all my cities
To waste and desolation

YOu are like a space invader
And by your own admission
You're a humanator

This game is over
This game is over
THis game is over
And This game is over

All the words that you said
Were all Lies
Invader
All the words that you said
Were all Lies
Invader

Come'in down
Come'in down
