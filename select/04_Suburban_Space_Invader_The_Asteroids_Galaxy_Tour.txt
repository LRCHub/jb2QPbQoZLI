Instruments Only: Prelude

Refrain:
Suburban space Invader,
They suck your soul,
They'll be messing with your brain.
Suburban space invader,
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same.

Part A:
Hey little girl,
Look at you
Sitting alone
At a table for two
Just can't wait
To get away
Get away
Every day
See your self
On the silver screen
Dancing queen
Just seventeen
You could do pretty fine...

We would do, we would do, we would do for you
We would do for you over night
Say aha hey,
Aha hey.

Fill your lungs,
Have no fear,
Ask youself,
Why you're here.
Time's running, they say,
Time's running, ooho.

Hurry up,
Don't ever stop,
No thinking about tomorrow,
Now hold it, hoooold it.
(Upbeat:) Open up your eyes!

Refrain:
Suburban space Invader,
They suck your soul,
They'll be messing with your brain.
Suburban space invader,
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same.

Instruments Only: Intermezzo

Part B:
Hey little boy,
Where you're at?
Money...
Got non of that.
Can't really run,
But you've got a car.
It won't get you there,
But it'll take you far.
Surf the grid, without a map
Serious fun turns into crap.
Silly boy,
Dry your eyes,
Don't take up the fight.
It'll do, It'll do, It'll do for you,
It'll do you for tonight
Don't freak out,
Don't freak out.

Hey little boy,
This is it,
. Hats
And laser kits.
Push it up, they say,
Push it up, ooho.
Get it on,
'Till you break him down.
Cuz' when you stop pretenden
And you lose it,
Lose it.
(Upbeat:) Singing one more time:

Refrain:
Suburban space Invader,
They suck your soul,
They'll be messing with your brain.
Suburban space invader,
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same.

Refrain:
Suburban space Invader,
They suck your soul,
They'll be messing with your brain.
Suburban space invader,
Now you're hot and cold
And you'll never be the same.
