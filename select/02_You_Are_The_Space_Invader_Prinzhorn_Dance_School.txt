You are the space invader
You are the space invader
You are the human invader
You are the space invader

Are you hiding away in Mansfield?
Are you hiding from your sister?
There's a baby boy and a baby girl
CCTV's stolen their souls

You are the space invader
You are the space invader
You are the human invader
You are the space invader

Are you hiding from your past life?
Are you hiding from the doctor?
He said white bread, cancer, cancer
And there's no clean air in Hampshire

Invader!
Invader!
Invader!
Invader!
